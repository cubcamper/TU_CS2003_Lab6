For my code I had an Account have one order and one customer. For my Umple code, I had an Account with many orders and one customer.
I like that the Umple code generated constructors automatically. The add order and remove order method auto-generated by Umple was cool.
I also liked the toString method. Reminds me of the Source-->auto-generate function in Eclipse.
It was interesting that UMPLE generated boolean mutator methods.
I like that Umple saved me typing and thinking time and energy so that I can think abstractly and work to create important methods.
